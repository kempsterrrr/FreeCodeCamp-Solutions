# FreeCodeCamp

This is where I will track my progression the FCC dev track. I am creating this half way through the Front End Dev certificate to practice using Git and so I have a space to practice refactoring my code. What I have found is that I can solve most of the challenges with nested loops and if else statements but I am certain there are more performant and understandable ways of writing the code using JavaScript features.

To reinforce my learning I will try and explain some of my solution as at the moment, I am working off the top of my head and if I were to try and tech someone anything but the basics I would get stuck quickly.

DISCLAIMER: I took this idea from [Rafase282](https://github.com/Rafase282)
